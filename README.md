## Info
`@cryb/api` is the core service used to handle requests from clients over REST and WebSocket.

Events such as Room creation, user authentication and requests to `@cryb/portals` to create VM instances are sent from `@cryb/api`.

### Status
`@cryb/api` has been actively developed internally since August 2019, and is now open source as of October 2019.

## Codebase
The codebase for `@cryb/api` is written in JavaScript, utilising TypeScript and Node.js. Express.js is used for our REST API, while the WebSocket API uses the `ws` module.

MongoDB is used as the primary database, while Redis is used for cache and PUB/SUB.

### Code Style
We ask that you follow our [code style guidelines](https://github.com/crybapp/library/blob/master/code-style/STYLE.md) when contributing to this repository.

We use TSLint in order to lint our code. Run `yarn lint` before committing any code to ensure it's clean.

*Note: while we have most rules covered in our `tslint.json` config, it's good practice to familarise yourself with our code style guidelines.*

### First time setup
First, clone the `@cryb/api` repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/crybapp/api.git
```

#### Installation
The following services need to be installed for `@cryb/api` to function:

* MongoDB
* Redis

We recommend that you run the following services alongside `@cryb/api`, but it's not required.
* `@cryb/portals`
* `@cryb/aperture`

You also need to install the required dependencies by running `yarn`.

Ensure that `.env.example` is either copied and renamed to `.env`, or is simply renamed to `.env`.

In this file, you'll need some values. Documentation is available in the `.env.example` file.

### Running the app locally

#### Background Services
Make sure that you have installed MongoDB and Redis, and they are both running locally on port 27017 and 6379 respectively.

The command to start MongoDB is `mongod`, and the command to start Redis is `redis-server`.
Most Linux distros will have those packaged, and will start automatically with your system.

If you're developing a feature that requires the VM infrastructure, then make sure `@cryb/portals` and `@cryb/aperture` are running.

#### Starting @cryb/api
To run `@cryb/api` in development mode, run `yarn dev`.

It is recommended that in production you run `yarn build`, then `yarn start`.

## Questions / Issues
